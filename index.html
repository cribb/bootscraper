    <h1>The Age of Clipper Ships</h1>
    <p>
      Clipper ships were fast sailing vessels of the 19th century, built for speed on long ocean routes.
      Their tall masts and vast areas of sail let them race across the seas carrying tea, wool, and gold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most clippers had narrow hulls, a sharp bow, and a large rig. They sacrificed cargo space for speed,
      hoping to beat competitors to market by days or even weeks.
